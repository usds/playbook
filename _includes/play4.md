## Build the service using agile and iterative practices

We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure by getting working software into users’ hands quickly, and by providing frequent opportunities for the delivery team members to adjust requirements and development plans based on watching people use prototypes and real software. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production. Following agile methodologies is a proven best practice for building digital services, and will increase our ability to build services that effectively meet user needs.

#### checklist
1. Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need addressed by the service as soon as possible, and not longer than three months from the beginning of any new digital project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
2. Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works for users, and identify improvements that should be made
3. Ensure the individuals building the service are in close communication using techniques such as war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
4. Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
5. Release features and improvements multiple times each month
6. Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
7. Use an “issue tracker” to catalog features and bugs
8. Use a source code version control system
9. Ensure entire team has access to the issue tracker and version control system
10. Use code reviews to ensure quality


#### key questions
- How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it has not shipped yet, when will it?
- How long does it take for a production deployment?
- How long in days are the iterations/sprints?
- Which source code version control system is being used?
- What tool is being used to track bugs and issue tickets?
- What tool is being used to manage the feature backlog?
- How often do you review and reprioritize the items in your feature and bug backlog?
- How do you collect user feedback during development and how is that feedback to improve the service? 
- At each stage of usability testing, what gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
