title: Make it simple and intuitive
---

Using a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting — it’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

#### checklist
1. Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service
2. Use the design style guide across related digital services
3. Provide users with clear information about where they are in the process as they use the service
4. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
5. Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
6. Use language that is familiar to the user and is easy to understand
7. Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including in the online and offline (non-digital) touch points people use to interact with the service

#### key questions
- What primary tasks is the user trying to accomplish?
- What is the reading level of the language the service uses?
- What languages is your service offered in?
- If a user needs help while using the service how do they go about getting it?
- How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?
