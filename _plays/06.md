title: Assign one leader and hold that person accountable
---

There must be a single person who has sufficient authority to ensure that the project receives organizational support and to shield the implemenation team from distractions.

This person communicates goals and constraints in sufficient detail for the team to make informed decisions.  The leader should be skilled in the moderation of discussions in order to ensure that all viewpoints are taken into consideration, and be willing to defer to the expertise of the team.

The leader is ultimately responsible for empowering the team to meet the needs of the product's users, which is how a service should be evaluated.

### Checklist
1. A leader has been identified
2. All team members agree that the leader can be relied upon to represent the team as they make decisions about features and technical implementation details
3. The leader has the technical experience to moderate discussions, assess alternatives, and weigh tradeoffs
4. The leader has a work plan that includes budget estimates and identifies funding sources
5. The leader has a strong relationship with the contracting officer

### Key Questions
- Who is the leader?
- What organizational changes have been made to ensure the leader has sufficient authority to support the implementation team?
- What does it take for the team to add or remove a feature from the service?
