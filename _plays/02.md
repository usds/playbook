title: Gather the Stakeholders
---

Putting in place a governance process where all stakeholders believe they are represented in the making of policy decisions is the fastest way to get complete acceptance and support for an IS&S Environment. A governance body can be created by executive order, legislative action, or by a consensus of leadership from sponsors or leading actors in the IS&S Environment. Essential to success is the formal assignment of responsibility to the individuals who are selected to represent the participating organizations. Governance bodies need a charter to define both the boundaries of their responsibility and authority and the processes for making decisions that affect all participants. Such a body is essential during early policy discussions on issues such as privacy, selection of standards, responsibilities for implementation, and other critical decisions shaping the IS&S Environment. The governance body will remain in place and active for the duration of the IS&S Environment lifecycle.

### Checklist
1. The governance body must include representatives of all stakeholder organizations that are impacted by the development of an IS&S Environment. 
2. The members assigned to the governance body should be formally appointed to serve by their agency’s executive.
3. The governance body must be empowered to make the important decisions that will shape the IS&S Environment.
4. All meetings should be issue-driven and documented.
5. Transparency of the governance body deliberations is essential.
6. The governance body must be supplied with adequate staff support to get things done.
7. Governance works best when the governance body develops its own charter and other organizational documents.
8. Work leading to policy decisions can be delegated to operational committees to expedite decision making.
