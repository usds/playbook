## The U.S. Digital Service Playbook

The American people expect to interact with government through digital channels such as websites, email, and mobile applications. By building better digital services that meet the needs of the people that use our services, we can make the delivery of our policy and programs more effective.

Today, too many of our digital services projects do not work well, are delivered late, or are over budget. To increase the success rate of these projects, the U.S. Government needs a new approach. We created a playbook of 13 key “plays” drawn from successful best practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help government build effective digital services.

## How it works
The playbook is organized into thirteen text files.

To work on the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/starter` in your browser.

To get SASS running: `sass --watch assets/sass/styles.css.scss:assets/css/styles.css`
